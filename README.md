# Mailbox Quota Alert

This PHP script utilises the SiteHost API to alert customers when mailboxes under their control exceed or get close to their quoted limits. It is a framework script that a customer can customise to their specific needs. It also features configurable console output and uses API keys that you can generate through the SiteHost Control Panel (cp.sitehost.nz).
